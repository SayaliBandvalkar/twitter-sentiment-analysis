        <p>
          TweetHub is a real-time sentiment analysis platform designed to fetch and analyze live tweets using the Twitter API.
          It leverages advanced NLP models like <b>LSTM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes</b> to classify tweets as positive, neutral, or negative.
          <br />
          The backend, built with <b>Flask</b>, efficiently processes real-time data, while the frontend, developed using <b>React</b>, provides an intuitive dashboard for sentiment visualization.
          <br />
          Analyzed tweets are stored in an <b>SQLite</b> database, making TweetHub a powerful tool to track public sentiment and online discussions. Even users can contribute to the platform by submitting their own tweets or can upload their own datasets using upload CSV.
